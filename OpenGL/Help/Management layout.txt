How the system works



			Scene static class
			Call scene Init() func from appliation.cpp file
			Then call draw func in scene class to render each time, this hadels buffer swaps etc, just one function call.

			Inside static class
			Calls all functions seperately for objects while also handling the function for the loop

			Objetcs
			objects have Init func which are called whn initing program or model, then draw func for use in scene draw function.

			Objects could be Cubes, Models, Etc
