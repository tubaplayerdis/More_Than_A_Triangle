LOGIC
{
* Ui element describing the amount of food you have
* Fat bar [Visual representation of fatness on a visual slider](Used at end of game)
* More unhealthy the food the fatter you get
* While eating mukbang your fat bar goes up and the amount of food you eat dictates on how fat you are(Amount of food is dictated by the amount you picked up in mission sequence
* You then weigh yourself(weight is dictated by how full your fat bar is)
* After weighing nikocado has reaction based off how heavy he is(Fatter the better)
* If you pick up salads accidentally it will decrease your fat bar in the mukbang
* If you accidentally run into a gym during mission you die
* Orlin may attack you with salads during mission
* You drive around in a shopping scooter on all maps and walk in house travel map you drive a car
* -Pick up food collectibles(picking up may take some time for certain foods)
